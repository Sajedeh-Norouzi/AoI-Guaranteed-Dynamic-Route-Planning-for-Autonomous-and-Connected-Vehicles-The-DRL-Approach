AoI-Guaranteed Dynamic Route Planning for Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: The DRL Approach
Overview

This repository contains the simulation code for the paper "AoI-Guaranteed Dynamic Route Planning for Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: The DRL Approach." The paper introduces a novel approach to dynamic route planning in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize both travel time and Age of Information (AoI).
Abstract

The advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has been significantly driven by progress in radio communication technology. Traditionally, dynamic route planning focuses on metrics such as route capacity and travel time. Our paper presents a dual-factor approach that integrates travel time estimation with radio resource availability into a comprehensive route planning scheme for autonomous and connected vehicles (ACVs). We propose a method called AoI-Guaranteed Dynamic Route Planning (AGDRP) which balances travel time and AoI, enhancing route planning efficiency as the system learns over time. Simulation results show that AGDRP outperforms traditional schemes focusing solely on travel time optimization. By incorporating AoI minimization, our approach not only directly improves performance but also contributes to more effective path planning compared to baseline methods.
